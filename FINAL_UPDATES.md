## 🐛 Logo Issue Fix

The university logo issue should be resolved with:
- Better file path handling
- Improved fallback display
- Enhanced sizing and positioning
- No filter effects that might hide logos

If a logo still doesn't show, check:
1. File exists in `logos/` folder
2. Filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. File format is PNG
4. File is not corrupted
